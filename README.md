This repo involves exploring basic ML algorithms to advanced DL networks like CNN and LSTM to classify time series into Periodic, Chaotic, Hyperchaotic and Noise by extracting Recurrence Features.

Recurrence Measures are easy to extract features and can act as a biodata for the dynamics of a complex system like variational stars, climatic patterns and any other system that generates time series data.
